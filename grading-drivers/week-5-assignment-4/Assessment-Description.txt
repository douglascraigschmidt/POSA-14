Week 5: Programming Assignment 4

Released Monday, June 9th, 2014
Due Monday, June 24th, 2014

In this assignment, you will implement a program that uses a
pattern-oriented ping-pong framework to spawn threads that correctly
alternate printing "Ping" and "Pong", respectively on either the
command-line display (of the Eclipse IDE) or in an Android TextView
(in either the AVD emulator or on an actual Android device).

In this directory you'll find Java source code, AndroidManifest.xml,
and associated XML metadata files.  The directory
W5-A4-Android/src/edu/vuum/mocca/ contains the skeleton Java code that
you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" comments
to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF
THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO - You fill in here" portions!!!

Although there are a lot of files, the actual amount of code you need
to write is small - the main goal is to understand the
pattern-oriented ping-pong framework and how to apply the Android
HaMeR framework.  In particular, you'll need to do the following:

. Read & understand the PingPongThreadSema and PingPongThreadCond
  classes, which are covered in these videos:
  
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 10: Java Synchronization and Schedule Example

. To understand these classes you'll also want to understand the Java
  ReentrantLock, ConditionObject, and Semaphore classes, which are
  covered in these videos:

  Section 1: Module 2: Part 5: Java ReentrantLock
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 7: Java Semaphore
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 8: Java ConditionObject

. Implement the hook methods in the AndroidPlatformStrategy.java class
  that use a Java CountDownLatch and Activity's runOnUiThread() method
  to post a Runnable command to the UI Thread, which are covered in
  these videos:

  Section 1: Module 2: Part 9: Java CountDownLatch
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 10: Java Synchronization and Scheduling Example

  There following videos on the Android HaMeR concurrency framework
  may also be useful to understand what's going on, especially the
  Part 4, which shows how the Activity.runOnUiThread() method works.

  Section 1: Module 3: Part 1: Overview of Android Concurrency Frameworks and Idioms
  Section 1: Module 3: Part 2: Android Looper
  Section 1: Module 3: Part 3: Overview of Android Handler
  Section 1: Module 3: Part 4: Posting and Processing Runnables to Android Handler

These videos are available at

https://class.coursera.org/posa-002/lecture

We'll also discuss this assignment specification (and later its
solution) in the POSA MOOC "Virtual Office Hours", which are described
in item #38 at the POSA MOOC FAQ available from

http://www.courera.org/course/posa

You'll need to build this Android application in the Eclipse ADT
environment.  By default, the output for the correct solution should
look similar to this (for both the Eclipse command-line and Android
versions):

Ready...Set...Go!
ping  (1)
_pong (1)
ping  (2)
_pong (2)
ping  (3)
_pong (3)
ping  (4)
_pong (4)
ping  (5)
_pong (5)
ping  (6)
_pong (6)
ping  (7)
_pong (7)
ping  (8)
_pong (8)
ping  (9)
_pong (9)
ping  (10)
_pong (10)
Done!

However, this assignment only requires you to create and test the
Android version.  BTW, the test assumes that each line of text is
formatted: <text content> + '\n'

To Run the Android Application, right click on the 'W5-A4-Android'
project and select [Run As] -> [Android Application]

To Run the Android Unit Test, right click on the 'W5-A4-Android-Test'
project and select [Run As] -> [Android Unit Test]
