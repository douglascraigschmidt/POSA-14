Week 3: Programming Assignment 2

Released Monday, May 26th, 2014
Due Monday, June 9th, 2014

In this assignment, you will use a Java ReentrantLock and Java
ConditionObject to implement a subset of the Java
java.util.concurrent.Semaphore class, which we call SimpleSemaphore.
This assignment also reuses the SimpleAtomicLong you implemented for
week-2-assignment-1, so make sure it's compiling and running properly
before attempting this assignment!

The goal of this assignment is to use the SimpleSemaphore to correctly
implement a resource manager that limits the number of Beings from
Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into a Palantir.  Please see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir for more information on
Palantirs if you're not yet a fan of Tolkein's Lord of the Ring's.

The PalantirManagerUnitTest.java program creates three Palantiri and
five Threads (one for each Palantir user) that concurrently attempt to
acquire a Palantir and gaze into it for a certain amount of time.  If
the SimpleSemaphore and SimpleAtomicLong are implemented properly the
test should succeed without throwing any exceptions, as described
further below.

In this directory you'll find a number of files, all of which you
should read.  However, the only two files you need to modify are
SimpleAtomicLong.java and SimpleSemaphore.java in the
src/edu/vuum/mocca directory, which contains the skeleton Java code
that you'll implement by completing the "TODO - You fill in here"
comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL
STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO - You fill in here"
portions!!!

In particular, you'll need to do the following:

. Implement the SimpleAtomicLong class, which you should replace with
  your solution to week-2-assignment-1, after applying any fixes
  suggested by peer graders.  This class is only used by the
  PalantirManagerUnitTest.java and should not be used in the
  SimpleSemaphore implementation itself.

. Implement the SimpleSemaphore class using a Java ConditionObject and
  Java ReentrantLock, which are covered in these videos:
  
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 5: Java ReentrantLock
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 8: Java ConditionObject 

  There are also relevant discussions about using Java
  ConditionObjects at these links that may help with the
  SimpleSemaphore implementation:

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11308768/condition-should-unlock-before-await

. Your SimpleSemaphore implementation must support the "Fair" and
  "NotFair" semantics, which are covered in this video:

  Section 1: Module 2: Part 7: Java Semaphore

  It's easy to support both these semantics if you watch the Java
  ReentrantLock video and understand how its constructor works.

. The PalantirManagerTest.java program also uses various features of
  Java Threads and Runnables, which are described in these videos:

  Section 1: Module 2: Part 1: Overview of Java Threads (Part 1)
  Section 1: Module 2: Part 2: Overview of Java Threads (Part 2)

We'll also discuss this assignment specification (and later its
solution) in the POSA MOOC "Virtual Office Hours", which are described
in item #38 at the POSA MOOC FAQ available from

http://www.coursera.org/course/posa

To compile this code you need to use the provided Eclipse project.
There is a Unit Test Suite that will run all three Unit test files
included in the test/ directory for you at once.  When you first open
the project in Eclipse, you might see compile errors if JUnit is not
included in your build path.  To fix these errors, open
SynchronizedQueueTest.java, hover over "org.junit," and click "Fix
project setup."  Make sure "Add JUnit 4 library to the build path" is
selected and then click "OK."  At this point, the compile errors
should disappear!

Right click on the test suite (AllTests.java) or an individual
*_UnitTest.java file in Eclipse and select 'Run As' -> 'JUnit
Test'. When the assignment is complete, 12 of 12 tests should complete
successfully.  If a test passes a green-check mark will appear next to
the test in the JUnit view.  As long as this JUnit test "passes"
successfully your program will be be consider "correct" for the
purposes of assessing this assignment.

If you'd like to enable verbose debugging output please set the
diagnosticsEnabled flag in PlanantirManagerUnitTest.java to true (it
defaults to false).  However, this will generate a lot of output and
you'll need to look at it carefully to understand what it's doing.  If
you do this, don't worry about "warnings" since there's an intentional
race condition in the test since it's possible for one thread to call
mFairnessChecker.addNewThread() and then yield to another thread which
again calls mFairnessChecker.addNewThread() and then goes on without
interruption to call mPalantirManager.acquirePalantir(), which will
fool the fairness checker into wrongly thinking the acquisition wasn't
fair.  We therefore just give a warning (rather than an error) if it
looks like the semaphore acquire() method isn't "fair".  The key is
not to have runtime exceptions, i.e., you want only "green-check
marks" in the JUnit view output!
