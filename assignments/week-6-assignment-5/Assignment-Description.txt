Week 6: Programming Assignment 5

Released Monday, June 16th, 2014
Due Monday, June 30th, 2014

In this assignment, you will implement a program that downloads images
using started services and then displays them in the context of the UI
Thread.  The user can optionally select one of two different Started
Services whose implementations you will complete:

. A simple DownloadIntentService that uses on the Android
  IntentService framework to download files in a single background
  Thread and

. A more scalable ThreadPoolDownloadService that uses a
  ThreadPoolExecutor to download several files concurrently within a
  fixed pool of Threads.

In this directory you'll find Java source code, AndroidManifest.xml,
and associated XML metadata files.  The directory
W6-A5-ThreadedDownloads-StartedServices/src/edu/vuum/mocca/ contains
the skeleton Java code that you'll implement by completing the "TODO -
You fill in here" comments to provide a working solution.  DO NOT
CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just fill in the "TODO
- You fill in here" portions!!!

The main goal of this project is to understand the pattern-oriented
threaded download application and how to start and interact with
Services using the IntentService and Messenger IPC mechanisms.  In
particular, you'll need to do the following:

. Understand how to launch Started Services using Intents and receive
  replies from Services using the Messenger IPC mechanism in the
  DownloadActivity class, which are covered in these videos:

  Section 1: Module 3: Part 5: Sending and Handling Messages with Android Handler
  Section 2: Module 1: Part 2: Programming Started Services (Part 1)
  Section 2: Module 1: Part 3: Programming Started Services (Part 2)

. Understand how to implement the DownloadIntentService and
  ThreadPoolDownloadService by handling Intents, doing work in the
  background, and sending results the Messenger IPC mechanism covered
  in these videos:
  
  Section 2: Module 1: Part 4: Android IntentService
  Section 2: Module 1: Part 6: Service to Activity Communication via Android Messenger

. Understand factory methods and implement the makeIntent() factory
  methods in each service, which are similar to the
  DownloadService.makeIntent() factory method covered in this video:

  Section 2: Module 1: Part 3: Programming Started Services (Part 2)

. Understand the ThreadPoolExecutor class and utilize a factory method
  in the Executors class to create a new thread pool, which is
  (briefly) outlined in this video

  Section 1: Module 3: Part 7: The AsyncTask Framework (Part 2)

  and described further in the documentation at:

  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html

. Understand the methods provided in the DownloadUtils class, which
  contains functionality that is common to both the
  DownloadIntentService and ThreadPoolDownloadService.

We'll also discuss this assignment specification (and later its
solution) in the POSA MOOC "Virtual Office Hours", which are described
in item #38 at the POSA MOOC FAQ available from

http://www.courera.org/course/posa

You'll need to build this Android application in the Eclipse ADT
environment.  Unlike previous assignments, this program is
user-driven, so output will vary depending on which URL is provided.
In addition to using the default URL (which is available from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/posa/ka.png) you should also
test this application by finding an Internet URL to an image (ending
in .jpg, .gif, .png etc.) and see if your application correctly
displays the image.

We provide several JUnit tests that should test your program's
functionality.  The unit tests test the Service classes independently
of the DownloadActivity, and then test the overall functionality of
the program.  By default, the unit tests try to download the default
URL and then check if the proper image was downloaded using Bitmap
comparison.

To Run the Android Application, right click on the 'W6-A5-Android'
project and select [Run As] -> [Android Application]

To Run the Android Unit Test, right click on the 'W6-A5-Android-Test'
project and select [Run As] -> [Android Unit Test]

By default, the application and test program do an "offline" download
since students often run this code an emulator or some other
environment with slow/no Internet connectivity.  If you'd like to
run/test it in the Internet please change the DOWNLOAD_OFFLINE boolean
in

W6-A5-ThreadedDownloads-StartedServices/src/edu/vuum/mocca/DownloadUtils.java

to false.
